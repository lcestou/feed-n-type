# Feed & Type

A gamified typing learning tool that makes typing practice engaging by using content kids actually care about!

## 🎮 Concept

Feed & Type transforms boring typing practice into an engaging experience by letting kids practice typing while reading about their favorite topics - Minecraft, Roblox, Yokai Watch, Pokemon, and more. 

Instead of typing random phrases like "The quick brown fox...", kids can:
- Read the latest news and updates about their favorite games
- Practice typing while staying informed about topics they love
- Progress through content that continuously expands as they type
- Build typing skills naturally while engaged with interesting content
