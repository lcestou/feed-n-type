# Research Results: Gamified Typing Trainer

**Feature**: 001-build-a-gamified
**Date**: 2025-01-21
**Status**: Complete

## Research Topics & Decisions

### 1. Svelte 5 Runes for State Management

**Decision**: Use Svelte 5 runes ($state, $derived, $effect) exclusively for all reactive state management

**Rationale**:

- Constitution mandates runes over Svelte stores
- Better TypeScript integration and type inference
- Simpler mental model for reactive state
- Performance improvements over stores
- Future-proof approach aligned with Svelte 5 direction

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Svelte 4 stores: Rejected (constitution violation, legacy approach)
- External state management (Zustand, Redux): Rejected (unnecessary complexity for local app)

**Implementation Notes**:

- Pet state: $state for happiness, evolution form, emotional state
- User progress: $state for WPM history, accuracy trends
- Derived calculations: $derived for real-time WPM, happiness calculations
- Side effects: $effect for local storage persistence, animations

### 2. Local Storage Architecture

**Decision**: Hybrid approach - IndexedDB for complex game data, localStorage for simple preferences

**Rationale**:

- IndexedDB handles structured pet evolution data, progress history
- localStorage perfect for user preferences, settings
- No external dependencies or API calls required
- Offline-first architecture supports constitutional privacy requirements
- Better performance for frequent reads/writes

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Single localStorage approach: Rejected (5MB limit, complex data serialization)
- External database: Rejected (violates local-only constitution requirement)
- File system APIs: Rejected (browser compatibility, permission complexity)

**Implementation Notes**:

- IndexedDB stores: pet_states, user_progress, achievements, content_cache
- localStorage stores: app_preferences, last_session, debug_settings
- Automatic migration system for data structure updates

### 3. Content Feed Integration Strategy

**Decision**: Static content feeds with periodic manual curation and updates

**Rationale**:

- Ensures all content is pre-filtered for age appropriateness
- No runtime API dependencies or external network calls
- Simplifies implementation and reduces potential failure points
- Parents can trust content is always safe and appropriate
- Enables offline functionality

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Live RSS feeds: Rejected (complexity, real-time safety concerns, network dependency)
- Scraping APIs: Rejected (rate limiting, content quality issues, legal concerns)
- User-generated content: Rejected (safety risks, moderation complexity)

**Implementation Notes**:

- JSON files in `/static/content/` directory
- Content categories: pokemon_news, nintendo_updates, roblox_highlights
- Manual update process with content review workflow
- Difficulty levels: beginner, intermediate, advanced
- Themed challenges for weekends and special events

### 4. Animation Performance Patterns

**Decision**: CSS transforms with requestAnimationFrame coordination for 60fps animations

**Rationale**:

- Hardware acceleration through CSS transforms
- Smooth performance on lower-end devices
- Battery efficiency compared to JavaScript-only animations
- Easier to maintain and debug
- Better integration with Svelte's reactivity

**Alternatives Considered**:

- JavaScript-only animations: Rejected (performance cost, battery drain)
- Web Animations API: Rejected (browser compatibility, unnecessary complexity)
- Third-party animation libraries: Rejected (bundle size, dependency overhead)

**Implementation Notes**:

- Pet movement: CSS transitions with transform3d
- Word falling animations: CSS keyframes with GPU acceleration
- Celebration effects: Coordinated CSS + requestAnimationFrame
- Performance budget: Maximum 16ms per animation frame

### 5. Accessibility for Children's Applications

**Decision**: ARIA live regions, semantic HTML, and comprehensive keyboard navigation

**Rationale**:

- Constitutional requirement for WCAG AAA compliance
- Children have diverse learning needs and abilities
- Screen reader support essential for inclusive design
- Keyboard navigation supports motor skill development
- High contrast design aids visual processing

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Visual-only interface: Rejected (excludes children with disabilities)
- Basic accessibility: Rejected (doesn't meet constitutional WCAG AAA requirement)
- Third-party accessibility widgets: Rejected (external dependency, customization limitations)

**Implementation Notes**:

- ARIA live regions for pet status updates and progress announcements
- Semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy
- High contrast color palette with 4.5:1 minimum ratios
- Large touch targets (48px minimum) for motor skill accessibility
- Alternative text for all images and icons
- Sound effects with visual equivalents for hearing accessibility

## Technology Stack Finalized

**Frontend Framework**: SvelteKit with Svelte 5 runes
**Language**: TypeScript (strict mode, zero 'any' types)
**Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with custom components
**Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E), Testing Library (components)
**Build Tool**: Vite (included with SvelteKit)
**Storage**: IndexedDB + localStorage hybrid
**Performance**: <200KB bundle, 60fps animations, <100ms interactions

## Risk Mitigation

**Browser Compatibility**: Modern browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
**Performance Degradation**: Progressive enhancement, graceful fallbacks
**Storage Limits**: Automatic cleanup, data compression strategies
**Content Staleness**: Manual update process with clear versioning
**Accessibility Compliance**: Automated testing, manual review process

## Next Steps

All research complete. Ready for Phase 1 design and contract generation.

**Confidence Level**: High - All technical decisions align with constitutional requirements and project constraints.
