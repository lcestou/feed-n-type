## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A child sits down to practice typing and is greeted by their Typingotchi pet waiting in its Game Boy-style playground. Fresh typing content from Pokemon, Nintendo, or Roblox appears on screen. As the child types each word correctly, it falls as food for their pet to eat. The pet grows happier and more animated with accurate typing. Over time, consistent daily practice helps the pet evolve into new forms. Parents can check progress without any data leaving the device.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a child opens the app for the first time, **When** they begin typing the displayed text, **Then** their virtual pet appears and starts eating correctly typed words
2. **Given** a child makes typing errors, **When** they press wrong keys, **Then** poop emojis appear instead of food and the pet shows temporary sadness
3. **Given** a child practices daily for a week, **When** they maintain good accuracy, **Then** their pet evolves to a new form and celebrates with animations
4. **Given** a parent wants to check progress, **When** they access the parent dashboard, **Then** they see typing accuracy trends, practice time, and challenging keys without any personal data
5. **Given** fresh gaming content is available, **When** the child starts a new session, **Then** typing challenges feature current Pokemon, Nintendo, or Roblox content
6. **Given** a child misses a day of practice, **When** they return, **Then** the streak system offers forgiveness and catch-up opportunities

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the child achieves 100% accuracy for an extended period?
- How does the system handle extremely slow typing speeds or long pauses?
- What occurs when gaming content sources are temporarily unavailable?
- How does the pet behave when returning after weeks of inactivity?
