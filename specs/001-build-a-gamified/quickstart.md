# Quickstart Guide: Gamified Typing Trainer

**Feature**: 001-build-a-gamified
**Purpose**: Validate implementation through user story walkthroughs
**Date**: 2025-01-21

## Prerequisites

- SvelteKit development environment
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Tailwind CSS v4 configured
- MCP Svelte documentation access (`mcp__svelte-llm`)

## User Story Validation Tests

### Test 1: First-Time User Experience

**Scenario**: Child opens app for the first time

**Steps**:

1. Navigate to application URL
2. Observe initial pet state (should be "Egg" form)
3. See welcome message and typing instruction
4. Begin typing displayed practice text
5. Verify pet animation starts when first word is typed correctly

**Expected Results**:

- Pet appears in Game Boy LCD playground
- Practice text from gaming content (Pokemon/Nintendo/Roblox)
- Virtual keyboard highlights next expected key
- Correctly typed words fall as food for pet
- Pet shows eating animation and happiness increase

**Validation Points**:

- [ ] Pet state initializes to Egg form with 50% happiness
- [ ] Content loaded from appropriate age range
- [ ] Keyboard highlighting works for next expected character
- [ ] Word feeding animation triggers on correct typing
- [ ] Real-time WPM calculation displays

### Test 2: Error Handling & Pet Reactions

**Scenario**: Child makes typing mistakes

**Steps**:

1. Start typing session with existing pet
2. Deliberately type wrong characters
3. Observe pet emotional response
4. Continue with correct typing
5. Watch pet mood recovery

**Expected Results**:

- Wrong keystrokes generate poop emojis instead of food
- Pet shows temporary sadness (slower movement, different animation)
- Poop counter increments in stats display
- Pet returns to normal state after correct typing resumes
- No punishment mechanics - mistakes are learning opportunities

**Validation Points**:

- [ ] Error visualization immediate and clear
- [ ] Pet emotional state changes appropriately
- [ ] No permanent negative effects from mistakes
- [ ] Encouragement over punishment approach maintained
- [ ] Stats tracking includes error count

### Test 3: Daily Practice & Evolution

**Scenario**: Child practices consistently for a week

**Steps**:

1. Complete typing session (minimum 100 words)
2. Return next day for second session
3. Continue daily practice for 7 days
4. Reach word count threshold for evolution
5. Witness pet evolution celebration

**Expected Results**:

- Streak counter increments daily
- Pet happiness improves with consistent practice
- Evolution triggers at word milestones (100 words: Egg â†’ Baby)
- Celebration animation and sound effects play
- New accessories unlock with evolution

**Validation Points**:

- [ ] Streak system tracks consecutive days accurately
- [ ] Evolution thresholds trigger correctly
- [ ] Celebration queue manages multiple events
- [ ] Accessory unlocks tied to achievements
- [ ] Pet form visually distinct between evolution stages

### Test 4: Parent Dashboard Access

**Scenario**: Parent wants to check child's progress

**Steps**:

1. Access parent dashboard (separate view or section)
2. Review typing accuracy trends over time
3. Examine practice time and session frequency
4. Identify challenging keys needing practice
5. Verify no personal data transmission

**Expected Results**:

- Clear visualization of progress metrics
- Accuracy and WPM trends over time periods
- Identification of improvement areas
- All data stored locally only
- Child-friendly language in progress descriptions

**Validation Points**:

- [ ] Dashboard accessible without login
- [ ] Metrics calculated from local storage only
- [ ] Trends show clear improvement patterns
- [ ] Challenging keys identified from error patterns
- [ ] Privacy compliance - no external data transmission

### Test 5: Content Variety & Engagement

**Scenario**: Child experiences different content sources

**Steps**:

1. Complete Pokemon-themed typing content
2. Switch to Nintendo character descriptions
3. Practice with Roblox game announcements
4. Experience weekend special challenge
5. Unlock themed achievements

**Expected Results**:

- Content rotates between three gaming sources
- Difficulty adapts to child's skill level
- Special weekend challenges offer bonus rewards
- Content remains age-appropriate and engaging
- Achievement system recognizes content completion

**Validation Points**:

- [ ] Content loading from all three sources works
- [ ] Age-appropriate filtering active
- [ ] Difficulty progression based on performance
- [ ] Special challenge content differentiated
- [ ] Themed achievement unlocks function

## Performance Validation

### Speed Requirements

- [ ] Initial app load: <3 seconds
- [ ] Keypress response: <16ms (60fps)
- [ ] Pet animation: Smooth 60fps
- [ ] Content loading: <200ms from cache
- [ ] Progress calculation: <100ms

### Accessibility Validation

- [ ] ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- [ ] Keyboard navigation throughout interface
- [ ] High contrast color scheme (WCAG AAA)
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Large touch targets (48px minimum)

### Storage Validation

- [ ] Data persists between sessions
- [ ] Local storage only (no network calls)
- [ ] Automatic cleanup of old data
- [ ] Migration handling for data structure changes
- [ ] Error recovery from corrupted data

## Integration Validation

### Component Integration

- [ ] TypingArea connects to progress tracking
- [ ] VirtualKeyboard highlights sync with text position
- [ ] Typingotchi responds to feeding events
- [ ] Stats display updates in real-time
- [ ] Parent dashboard pulls from same data sources

### Service Integration

- [ ] ContentService provides filtered content
- [ ] PetStateService manages evolution properly
- [ ] ProgressTrackingService calculates metrics accurately
- [ ] AchievementService triggers unlocks correctly
- [ ] All services handle errors gracefully

## Success Criteria

**Feature Complete When**:

- All user story validation tests pass
- Performance requirements met
- Accessibility compliance verified
- No console errors or warnings
- Constitution requirements satisfied (MCP usage, quality gates)

**Ready for Production When**:

- `bun check` passes with zero errors
- `bun build` generates optimized bundle <200KB
- Manual testing confirms smooth user experience
- Cross-browser compatibility verified
- Parent approval obtained for child safety features

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:
