# Tasks: Gamified Typing Trainer with Virtual Pet

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-build-a-gamified/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md âœ…, research.md âœ…, data-model.md âœ…, contracts/ âœ…

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory âœ…
   â†’ Tech stack: SvelteKit + Svelte 5 runes + TypeScript strict + Tailwind v4
   â†’ Storage: IndexedDB + localStorage hybrid
   â†’ Privacy: Local only, zero external data transmission
2. Load design documents âœ…
   â†’ data-model.md: 5 entities (PetState, UserProgress, StreakData, ContentItem, AchievementProgress)
   â†’ contracts/: 4 services (Content, PetState, ProgressTracking, Achievement)
   â†’ quickstart.md: 5 user story validation scenarios
3. Generate tasks by category âœ…
   â†’ Setup: Storage utilities, type definitions, service foundations
   â†’ Tests: Contract tests [P], integration tests [P] (TDD approach)
   â†’ Core: Data models [P], service implementations, component enhancements
   â†’ Integration: Service connections, existing component preservation
   â†’ Polish: Performance, accessibility, validation
4. Task rules applied âœ…
   â†’ Different files = [P] for parallel execution
   â†’ Same file = sequential (preserve existing working components)
   â†’ Tests before implementation (TDD mandatory)
5. Tasks numbered T001-T038 âœ…
6. Dependencies documented âœ…
7. Parallel execution examples provided âœ…
```

## Implementation Standards

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:

- ALWAYS use `mcp__svelte-llm__list_sections` â†’ `get_documentation` before writing ANY Svelte 5 code
- ZERO 'any' types - strict TypeScript throughout
- Every task must pass: `pnpm check` â†’ `pnpm build` â†’ manual test
- Preserve ALL existing functionality while enhancing components

**Component Enhancement Guidelines**:

- Work WITH existing TypingArea, VirtualKeyboard, Typingotchi, and main page components
- Add new functionality through service integration rather than replacement
- Maintain existing visual design and user experience
- Test that existing features continue working after enhancements

**Service Architecture**:

- Interface-based design for future extensibility
- Local storage only (IndexedDB + localStorage)
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Performance targets: <200KB bundle, 60fps animations, <100ms interactions

## Validation Checklist

**GATE: Verified before task execution**

- [x] All 4 contracts have corresponding test tasks (T005-T008)
- [x] All 5 entities have model tasks (T014-T018)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T005-T013 before T014-T034)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files, no shared dependencies)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path for immediate execution
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Existing component preservation explicitly marked with ðŸš¨ PRESERVE
- [x] TDD workflow enforced (failing tests required before implementation)

## Success Criteria

**Feature Complete When**:

- All user story validation tests pass (T009-T013)
- Existing typing trainer functionality preserved and enhanced
- Pet evolution system working with celebrations
- Parent dashboard displaying progress metrics
- All constitutional requirements satisfied (MCP usage, quality gates)

**Ready for Production When**:

- `pnpm check` passes with zero errors
- `pnpm build` generates bundle <200KB
- quickstart.md scenarios execute successfully
- Cross-browser compatibility verified
- Performance targets met (60fps animations, <100ms interactions)
