# Future Features Roadmap: Feed-n-Type

**Created**: 2025-01-21
**Status**: Vision Document
**Purpose**: Capture future expansion ideas with ready-to-use implementation prompts

## Vision Statement

Transform Feed-n-Type from a kids' gaming typing trainer into a universal typing platform where users can practice typing with ANY content they're interested in - news feeds, books, blogs, social media, academic papers - while maintaining the engaging gamification that makes practice fun.

## Feature 002: Dynamic Feed System

### Overview

Enable users to select and import content from any source - RSS feeds, WordPress blogs, PDFs, social media APIs - creating personalized typing practice from content they actually want to read.

### Ready-to-Use Prompt

```
/specify Build a dynamic content feed system for Feed-n-Type that lets users practice typing with ANY content source they choose.

**Core Experience:**
Users can add RSS/XML feeds from their favorite websites (news sites, blogs, WordPress sites) and the typing practice automatically pulls fresh content daily. As users type passages correctly, they "unlock" the ability to read the full article - creating an incentive to type accurately. The existing Typingotchi pet still gets fed with correctly typed words, but now from content the user actually cares about.

**Feed Sources to Support:**
- RSS/XML feeds from any website or blog
- WordPress REST API for WordPress sites
- PDF upload for books, documents, academic papers
- Plain text paste for custom content
- Social media feeds (Twitter/X, Reddit, LinkedIn)
- News aggregators (Google News, Apple News format)
- Podcast transcripts
- YouTube video captions

**Content Selection Interface:**
- Feed discovery: Browse categories (Tech, Cooking, Sports, Celebrity, Gaming, Education)
- Custom feed URL input with validation
- Feed preview before subscribing
- Multiple feed management (add, remove, prioritize)
- Content filtering by difficulty, length, or keywords
- Scheduled content rotation (different feeds for different times/days)

**Unlock-to-Read Mechanic:**
- Type first paragraph to unlock full article
- Progressive unlocking: Each paragraph typed reveals the next
- Accuracy threshold: Must type with 85% accuracy to unlock
- Save progress: Return later to continue unlocking long articles
- Bookmarking system for interesting unlocked content
- Export unlocked articles to reading list

**User Modes:**
- Kids Mode (7-12): Curated safe feeds only, existing parental controls
- Teen Mode (13-17): Moderated feeds, some social media access
- Adult Mode (18+): Full access to all feed types, professional content
- Study Mode: Academic papers, textbooks, learning materials
- Speed Mode: News headlines, tweets, short-form content

**Privacy & Safety:**
- Content caching for offline practice
- Adult content filtering options
- Profanity filtering toggles
- COPPA compliance for kids mode
- No account required for basic feeds
- Optional cloud sync for premium features

The magic happens when typing practice becomes reading time - users improve their typing while catching up on content they actually want to consume.

## Architecture Considerations for Future Features

**Design Decisions to Make Now:**

- Use interface-based content providers for easy extension
- Abstract typing mechanics from content source
- Design data models to support multiple content types
- Keep gamification system modular and configurable
- Plan for user accounts while maintaining anonymous mode
- Structure services for future cloud sync capability
- Design with API-first approach for future integrations

## Quick Start Commands for Future Features

When ready to implement each feature:

```bash
# Feature 002: Dynamic Feeds
/specify [paste the full Feed System prompt above]
/plan Focus on RSS parsing, content filtering, and feed management architecture
/tasks Break down feed integration without breaking existing game mechanics

# Feature 003: Social
/specify [paste the Social Features prompt above]
/plan Design real-time infrastructure while maintaining privacy
/tasks Implement multiplayer without compromising safety

# Continue pattern for each feature...
```

## Notes for Future Implementation

- Each feature should be a separate branch (feat/002-dynamic-feeds, etc.)
- Run full regression testing when adding features
- Maintain backward compatibility with kids mode
- Keep constitution principles (MCP usage, privacy, safety)
- Document API changes for each feature addition
- Consider feature flags for gradual rollout
- Plan for A/B testing of new features

---

**Remember**: The current 001-build-a-gamified implementation is the foundation. Complete it first, then expand systematically using these documented features.
