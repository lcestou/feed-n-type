Deep educational explanations with examples and learning-focused guidance

**CRITICAL**: Agent must use TodoWrite tool to track learning progress and keep user informed

## Usage

- `/learn svelte 5 runes` - Understand $state, $derived, $effect patterns
- `/learn typescript generics` - Deep dive into generic types and constraints
- `/learn sveltekit routing` - Learn routing, load functions, and layouts
- `/learn tailwind best practices` - Modern utility patterns and design systems

## What it does

1. **Concept Explanation**: Breaks down complex topics into digestible parts
2. **Practical Examples**: Provides working code samples from your project context
3. **Best Practices**: Explains the "why" behind recommended approaches
4. **Common Pitfalls**: Identifies mistakes and how to avoid them
5. **Interactive Learning**: Step-by-step tutorials with real implementations
6. **Resource Compilation**: Curates additional learning materials and references

**Progress Tracking**: Agent updates todo showing concepts explained and examples provided

## Tech Stack Learning Focus

- **MCP Priority**: Uses **mcp**context7**\*** for up-to-date documentation
- **Svelte 5**: Runes patterns, component composition, lifecycle management
- **SvelteKit 2**: Routing, server functions, data loading, form handling
- **TypeScript**: Advanced types, generics, strict mode patterns
- **Tailwind v4**: Modern utilities, responsive design, accessibility
- **Gaming Development**: Interactive UI patterns, state management, animations

## Learning Categories

### Framework Patterns

- **Svelte 5 Runes**: State management, reactivity, component patterns
- **SvelteKit Architecture**: File-based routing, server integration, deployment
- **Component Design**: Props, events, slots, composition patterns

### Language Features

- **TypeScript Advanced**: Generics, utility types, conditional types
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES2024 features, async patterns, module systems
- **CSS Modern**: Grid, Flexbox, custom properties, animations

### Development Practices

- **Testing Strategies**: Unit, integration, E2E testing approaches
- **Performance Optimization**: Bundle analysis, rendering optimization
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance, semantic HTML, screen readers

## Learning Approach

- **Conceptual Understanding**: Why patterns exist and when to use them
- **Code-along Examples**: Interactive tutorials with your actual codebase
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, build to advanced concepts
- **Real-world Application**: How concepts apply to your typing game project
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and debugging strategies

## Best suited for

- Understanding new framework features or patterns
- Deepening knowledge of TypeScript or modern JavaScript
- Learning testing strategies and implementation
- Mastering responsive design and accessibility
- Exploring advanced Svelte/SvelteKit patterns
- Gaining insights into performance optimization techniques

**Tip**: Ask specific questions like "why use $derived instead of $state" or "when should I use load functions vs onMount"
